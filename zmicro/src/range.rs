//! Ranges.
//!
//! This module contains the main primitive in zmicro.

/// A range.
///
/// This is the main primitive in the range encoding techniques. Ranges represent some variable
/// size block of the stream, which breaks down to bits.
///
/// Bits are read and written according to some probability. When a bit is written, the range
/// updates to a smaller subrange. The subrange's size is determined according to the probability
/// of the bit being 0. If the bit written is 0, and the probability pridiction was `Pr(0) = p`,
/// then the range's new size is `pÂ·r` with `r` being the old size.
///
/// Ranges has an important invariant: They can never be of zero size. If a range is of size 1,
/// however, the range is said to be _exhausted_, meaning that it cannot store any more
/// information.
///
/// This concept might seem weird as first, but it is incredibly logical: The more correct the
/// prediction is, the less the range narrows, and consequently it is exhausted earlier, meaning
/// that it can store more information.
///
/// As such, the efficiency depends entirely on the predictor, and the only theoretical bound that
/// exists is the state space.

    /// The start of the range.

    /// This pushes `bit` to the stream represented in the range, with the probability `pr_0` of
    /// being 0 (`false`).

    /// `pr_0` linearly corresponds to the probability, but is represented as an integer for
    /// performance reasons. As such, 0.5 corresponds to 0x7FFFFFFF, 1 corresponds to 0xFFFFFFFF,
    /// and 0 corresponds to 0.
