# TFS: A next-gen filesystem

TFS (abbrv. Ticki's File System or The File System) is a file system loosly based on ZFS, but with improved features. TFS includes support for O(1) snapshotting, caching, error correction, compression, and more.

It was originally designed for Redox OS, but will work on Linux and BSD too.
